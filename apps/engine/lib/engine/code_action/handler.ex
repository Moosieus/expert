  Returns the handler's actions for the given document and range.

  The diagnostics come from the request's context: those the client knows to overlap the range,
  which diagnostic-driven handlers match against to offer fixes.

  `opts` carries the request options (see the "Options" section of `Engine.CodeAction.for_range/6`).
  Code actions that support deferred edits to `codeAction/resolve` honor `defer_edits?`
  there; the rest ignore `opts` and always return their edits inline.
